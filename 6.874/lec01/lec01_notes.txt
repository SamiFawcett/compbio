Introduction to Machine Learning:
What is covered:
 - Bayesian Inference
  - Want to get from P(D | H) to P(H | D)
     * Probability of the Data given the hypothesis to Probability of the hypothesis given the data.
  - P(H | D) = ( P(D | H) * P(H) ) / P(D)


 - Classification vs Clustering
  - Classification (supervised)
    * labels
    * feature extraction
    * metric: classification accuracy
  - Clustering
    * no labels
    * identify structure in data
    * metric: independent validation features

  - How are they related?
   - Expectation Maximization 
    * Iterative estimation of generative model parameters



  - Support Vector Machines
  - L1 & L2 Regularization (L1 -> lasso and L2 -> ridge)
  - Not all Learning is Deep
    *Rule based systems
    *Classic Machine learning
    *Representation Learning
